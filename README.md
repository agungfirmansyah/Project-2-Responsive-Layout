Treehouse Project 2 - Responsive Layout

This is my second project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer. 
Here are my project notes so I can track my learning.

*Notes n' Tweaks*

- Custom font for name, attempted to use @font-face css for the first time.
- Chose some colors for the background, block elements, and hovers
- Border around my picture
- Added more gallery items than required
- Used flexbox for the first time
- Added Skills section with color blocks
- Used fontawesome for icons
- Used a script from CSS Tricks to get a smooth scroll

This project was super useful because copying a mockup was not something I have done before, and I feel 
confident I can do that now. 
It also gave me the experience of doing layout from scratch rather than using a framework.

*Needs Work*

- I feel like my CSS isn't as DRY as it could be.
- I am less confident about design aspects like choices of colors
- I think the design may not meet accessibility criteria
- Some of my CSS for margins/padding feels pretty janky/hacky, but I can't really say why.
- Time to complete (about 2 weeks; week 1 layout & required features; week 2 tweaks, design improvements)
